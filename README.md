# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementations

This repository contains C programs implementing various searching, sorting, and data structure techniques. Each program is designed to demonstrate the functionality of a specific algorithm or data structure.

## Programs Included

1. **Linear and Binary Search**
    - `linear_search.c`: Implements linear search algorithm.
    - `binary_search.c`: Implements binary search algorithm.

2. **Sorting Techniques**
    - `bubble_sort.c`: Implements bubble sort algorithm.
    - `selection_sort.c`: Implements selection sort algorithm.
    - `insertion_sort.c`: Implements insertion sort algorithm.
    - `merge_sort.c`: Implements merge sort algorithm.
    - `quick_sort.c`: Implements quick sort algorithm.

3. **Singly Linked List Operations**
    - `singly_linked_list.c`: Implements a menu-driven program for singly linked list operations including create, insert, delete, reverse, and concatenate.

4. **Doubly Linked List Operations**
    - `doubly_linked_list1.c`: Implements a menu-driven program for doubly linked list operations including create, insert, delete, reverse, and concatenate.
    - `doubly_linked_list2.c`: Another implementation of doubly linked list operations.

5. **Binary Search Tree Operations**
    - `binary_search_tree.c`: Implements a menu-driven program for binary search tree operations including creation, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), and search.

6. **Graph Operations**
    - `graph_adjacency_list.c`: Implements insertion and deletion of nodes in a graph using adjacency list representation.
    - `dijkstra_shortest_path.c`: Implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for a given directed graph.
    - `breadth_first_search.c`: Implements Breadth First Search using linked representation of a graph.
    - `depth_first_search.c`: Implements Depth First Search using linked representation of a graph.

## How to Run

Each program is a standalone C file. To run a program, you can compile it using a C compiler such as GCC and then execute the generated executable.

Example:
```bash
gcc linear_search.c -o linear_search
./linear_search
